## battlesnake-go

Requires Glide to run with `make run`

Takes advantage of go routines and channels to think about configurable moves ahead via the api/values.go file

Is not the cleanest code as the EstimateValue function is kind of a cluster given it was written for a Hackathon

Given more time would convert the values file into a database that does learning to make the values better instead of being
decided by a human running the code and tweaking.

Based off of the starter-snake-go provided by the battlesnakeio repo.
